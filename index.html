        <p class="intro">
        Pixelmator Pro comes with a collection of over 60 versatile effects
        that you<br> can mix and combine to develop any artistic or special effects
        you can<br> imagine. Effects are nondestructive, so you can always edit,
        rearrange, or<br> remove an effect after applying it. And you can even apply
        multiple effects to<br> a single layer — seeing all your changes in real time.
